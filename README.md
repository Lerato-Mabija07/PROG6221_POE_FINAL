This is a Recipe Application that has a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The application enables users to enter multiple recipes along with its details. Visual Studio is the software that was used to compile the application. The source code can be accessed through the zipped folder which is submitted on Learn.

This application enables users to enter the details of the recipe, display the recipe, clear all the data and exit the application in a more user-friendly way.

Getting Started:

Open the zipped folder and open the file (MainWindow.xmal) which will take you to Visual Studio. Click on start without bugging (ctrl + F5) to compile the application. Follow the on-screen instructions.
